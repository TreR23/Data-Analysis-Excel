-- This is the script I used to geocode the zipcodes for each property address because they were not included and I needed them to match the county to the property.

function geo2zip(a) {
  var response=Maps.newGeocoder()
    .reverseGeocode(lat(a),long(a));
  return response.results[0].formatted_address.split(',')[2].trim().split(' ')[1];
}
function lat(pointa) {
 var response = Maps.newGeocoder()
     .geocode(pointa);
  return response.results[0].geometry.location.lat
}
function long(pointa) {
  var response = Maps.newGeocoder()
     .geocode(pointa);
  return response.results[0].geometry.location.lng
}

-- Then I used this formula within the sheet to execute the script

=geo2zip(F2)

-- I used this formula to search for the property county using the newly identified zip code based on a list of postal codes and counties I downloaded.

=VLOOKUP(H2,'Mississippi Zip Codes & Counties'!$A$2:$B$424, 2, FALSE)

-- Finally this formula looks up if that county is present on the list of counties that are identified as persistent poverty counties.

=IF((VLOOKUP(I2,'Persistent Poverty Counties'!B3:B50)), VLOOKUP(I2, 'Persistent Poverty Counties'!B3:C50, 2, FALSE), FALSE)
